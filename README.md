# Retired

This code was written to provision a cluster of servers running an older version of Unhangout that is no longer maintained.  It is unlikely to be of any value without significant modification.

--------

# Unhangout ansible automation

This repository contains work-in-progress ansible configurations to create
multiple unhangout servers, load testers, and load balancing server, in order to
support events in the several thousands of users.

# Configuration

Configuration is managed by the playbook files and ansible-vault. TODO more explanation
